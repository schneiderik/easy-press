<p>Easy Press is a small publisher/printer located in the Wallingford area of Seattle, Washington operated by <a href="http://schneiderik.com">Erik</a> and <a href="http://christine-gutierrez.com">Christine</a> Schneider Gutierrez. We focus on comics, art prints and illustration zines.</p>

<p>We print almost entirely on a Risograph MZ990 Digital Duplicator. Risograph printing a unique printing process best explained by <a href="https://issue.press/printing">other</a> <a href="http://www.perfectly-acceptable.com/print/">people</a>. I currently stock <a href="http://stencil.wiki/colors">black, blue, green, yellow, bright red and mahogany inks</a>.</p>

<p>What sets Easy Press apart is that we just do this as a labor of love. We want to meet artists in the area, work with them on a project, and make something at the end that we're all proud of. We want to show you the printing process and have you over to help make your books. We only charge for the materials we use plus a small labor fee if we are doing most of the work. Depending on the project, we might ask for a couple of the items to sell on our own and at events as "payment".</p>

<p>If that sounds like something you would be into, send us an <a href="mailto:erik.schneider41@gmail.com">email</a> with a brief overview of the project.</p>
