  <h2>Token 2: January 13, 2016</h2>
  <p>
     Token is coming back at the beginning of 2016! Emporium in Logan Square has invited us back for another night of great local art and live music. Token 2 will be slightly larger and much more organized.
  </p>

  <h3>Applying to Token:</h3>

  <p>
    Token is a curated show because we would like to include a diverse-as-possible exhibitor line-up.
  </p>

  <p>
    For this show, every exhibitor, unless otherwise agreed upon by Christine and Erik,
    is limited to a half table. If you only have one or two items, still apply!
    We will be buddying up exhibitors that only have a few things into group tables
    comprised of 3 or 4 exhibitors.  Tables at the venue are 7x3.5 feet, so there
    is enough space. Just note in your application that you would like/be willing to
    table at a group table.  This will help us get as many talented people in Token as we can!
  </p>

  <p>
    The application deadline is midnight, Friday, December 18.
    We will be reviewing applications as they come in.
  </p>

  <p>
    All applicants will be notified on Tuesday, December 22 if they were selected or not.
  </p>

  <p>
    Token 1 was held at Emporium in Logan Square near the end of 2015.  After months of planning,
    the day before the event Erik had to rush to the hospital to have his appendix removed.
    The event still went on; and with the help of family, friends and exhibitors, Token was a
    great success.  The night included music by <a href="http://christine-gutierrez.com">Cat Claw</a>,
    as well as perfomances by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/williamsidesatariparty/">William Sides Atari Party</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DiodeMilliampere/?fref=ts">Diode Milliampere</a>.
    <a href="http://pabstblueribbon.com/">Pabst Blue Ribbon</a> and <a href="http://do312.com/">Do312</a> provided discounted drinks,
    and a photo booth was graciously provided by <a href="http://www.glitterguts.com/">Glitter Guts</a>.
